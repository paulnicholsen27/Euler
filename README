A repository containing some of my solutions to some problems from Project Euler (pronounced 'Oiler', to help others from having to be corrected as I was).

I'm particularly fond of my solutions to problems 18 and 67, which required a
recursive solution to find the shortest path from the top of the triangle to the bottom.
The triangle in 18 was only 15 rows deep and so was able to be solved with brute force,
but 67's array was substantially larger and needed a more efficient solution.
Which I found.
